At this time there's only 2 ways to change your email address...

If you have a parent code...

1. Visit www.classdojo.com/parent and enter your parent code.
2. Create a new account under the desired email address

If you do not have a parent code...

At this time only your child's teacher can change the email address your reports are sent to.
Can you please contact your child's teacher and ask them to update the email address the reports are sent to?
Once the new email is entered, you will receive a email inviting you to create a new account.
